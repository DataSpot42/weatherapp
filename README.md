# Weather App
Bootcamp Project

During the bootcamp we were tasked with developing an app that used an API of our choosing.  I chose a weather forecast API provied by Open Weather.  As this API requited co-ordinates as a location I had to also use an API to fetch them when the user provided a location.  A further development was to use Google Location Auto-complete and to add a 12hr and a 5 day 3 hourly forecast.  Still tweaking for mobile usage.
